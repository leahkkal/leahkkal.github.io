	<h2>Make a Difference Today</h2>

	<p>“I felt strongly that when I retired, I needed to give back,” says Sibley Hospital volunteer Patty Mason, pictured here with Erica Richards, M.D., Ph.D., chair and medical director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Sibley. Patty made a planned gift to Sibley in honor of her father, a psychiatrist who admitted patients to Sibley, and her mother, who led an art therapy program at the hospital.</p>
